1. What bugs and conceptual difficulties did you encounter? How did you overcome them? What did you learn?
      I encounter the issue of representing a probability distribution. At first, I was going to create a 2d grid
      for each features which contains the probabilities for each given locations. However, I opted to only leave
      Last Location as the grid. The other features were created with my DistribList object which is a HashMap with
      Keys mapping to "given" and Values being a list of "outcomes" associated to that given.
          (Ex: P(Outcomes|Given), Map<Given : List[Outcomes, P()]>)

2. Describe whatever help (if any) that you received. Donâ€™t include readings, lectures, and exercises, but do
   include any help from other sources, such as websites or people (including classmates and friends) and attribute
   them by name.
        I relay on GreeksForGreeks article of BigDecimal to understand how and when to use BigDecimals.

3. Describe any serious problems you encountered while writing the program.
        No serious problem.

4. Mention any challenges that you did.
      No challenges were attempted.

5. List any other feedback you have. Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment,
   and whether you enjoyed doing it.
      I Enjoy this particular assignment because it was my first time implementing a math problem (probabilities) into
      a OOP style.
