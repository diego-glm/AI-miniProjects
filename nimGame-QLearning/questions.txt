1. What bugs and conceptual difficulties did you encounter? How did you overcome them? What did you learn?
Answer: No bugs or conceptual difficulties I encounter. This project was very similar to project 3 so I relay on that.

2. Describe whatever help (if any) that you received. Donâ€™t include readings, lectures, and exercises, but do include any help from other sources, such as websites or people (including classmates and friends) and attribute them by name.
Answer: I copy the Player class implementation from the connect-4 project.

3. Describe any serious problems you encountered while writing the program.
Answer: I had to debug to figure out why the update function stop to one call of "gamma * min/max(Q(s', a'))". The issue was using Double.<Neg/Pos>_INFINITY
        and making sure to return 0.0 when no Q values were found.

4. Mention any challenges that you did. Answer: None.

5. List any other feedback you have. Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.
Answer: I enjoy this project because this gives me enough imagination in how I would employ this algorithm with other board/mini games.
